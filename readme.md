**Models and Components**

1. Text Generation Model
2. Audio Generation Model
3. 3D Animation Model

The goal of this model is to create an augmented reality (AR) artificial intelligence (AI) project that functions as a virtual assistant. This assistant should be able to perform a variety of actions, express different moods, and adapt to different environments and outfits.

## 3D Model Creation and Animation

To create 3D models and animations, you can use software like Blender or Maya. These tools allow you to create and animate 3D models. For this project, you might create models for a robot, a man, and a woman. Each of these models can then be animated to perform different actions, such as searching, looking, and hearing.

### Actions

Each model should be able to perform a variety of actions. These actions can be created as animations in Blender or Maya, and then triggered by the AI based on the context of the user's request. For example, if the user asks the AI to look for something, the AI could trigger the "searching" animation.

### Moods

In addition to actions, the models should also be able to express different moods. These moods could be represented by different facial expressions or body language. For example, the model could have a "happy" animation where it smiles, or a "sad" animation where it frowns.

### Environments and Outfits

The models should also be able to adapt to different environments and outfits. This could be achieved by creating different versions of each model for different environments, or by creating modular models that can be customized with different outfits.

## Project File Organization

To keep your project organized, you might use a folder structure like the following:

```
/my-project
  /models
    /robot
      /actions
      /moods
      /environments
      /outfits
    /man
      /actions
      /moods
      /environments
      /outfits
    /woman
      /actions
      /moods
      /environments
      /outfits
  /animations
  /environments
  /outfits
```

In this structure, each model has its own folder, which contains subfolders for actions, moods, environments, and outfits. The animations, environments, and outfits folders at the root level could be used to store assets that are shared between multiple models.

## Additional Data

In addition to the 3D models and animations, you might also need data for the AI to use when interacting with the user. This could include a language model for understanding and generating text, as well as a database of user preferences and history for personalizing the AI's responses.

**Dev - Prod**

In Development:

Developers can use docker-compose.dev.yml to run all services with configurations suitable for development.
The init-dev.sh script can set up any necessary development environment details such as building images, starting containers, etc.

In Production:

docker-compose.prod.yml would contain configurations for production, such as setting up volumes for persistence, environment variables for production databases, etc.
The init-prod.sh script would handle setting up the production environment.
Adding a New Service:

To add a new service, create a new directory under services/ with its Dockerfile and any other service-specific files.
Include the service in the docker-compose.dev.yml and docker-compose.prod.yml with the necessary overrides for each environment.
Running Services:

For development, one would run scripts/init-dev.sh or docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up.
For production, one would run scripts/init-prod.sh or docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up.
Remember, it's important to update the README.md with instructions for setting up and running the services in both development and production environments. This structure should allow for easy scaling and management of your services within the repository.


**Quick Guide to Run Docker Commands.**

Introduction:
Docker is an essential tool for developers, making it easier to create, deploy, and run applications using containerization. It enables applications to work in any environment, making the whole process more efficient and flexible. This blog post will introduce you to some of the most important Docker commands, helping you get up and running quickly with this powerful tool.

1. Building Docker Images:
The Docker `build` command builds an image from a Docker file. It's usually used in the same directory as your Dockerfile.

```bash
docker build --build-arg NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN=<your_ngrok_auth_token> -t docker-llm .
```

Here, `docker-llm` is the name you want to give your Docker image, and the `.` indicates that Docker should look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.

2. Running Docker Containers:
You can run a Docker container from an image using the `run` command.

```bash
docker run -d -p 5001:5001 --name=llm-container docker-llm
```

The `-d` option runs the container in detached mode (in the background), and the `-p` option maps the host port to the container port.

3. Listing Docker Containers:
To list all running Docker containers, use the `ps` command. 

```bash
docker ps
```

To list all Docker containers, whether running or stopped, use `ps -a`.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

4. Start the Docker Container: 
To start a running Docker container, use the `start` command.

```bash
docker start llm-container
```

5. Accessing a Running Container's Shell:
You can use the `exec` command to access the shell of a running Docker container.

```bash
docker exec -it llm-container /bin/bash
```

Here, `my-container` is the name of your running container, and `/bin/bash` opens a Bash shell in the container.

6. Stopping and Removing Docker Containers:
To stop a running Docker container, use the `stop` command.

```bash
docker stop my-container
```

After a container is stopped, you can remove it with the `rm` command.

```bash
docker rm my-container
```
Run Ngrok commands after running `docker exec`: 

7. **Inside the Docker container shell, authenticate your ngrok instance**. Replace `your_auth_token` with the auth token from your ngrok account. You can find this token on the "Auth" page of the ngrok dashboard:

```bash
./ngrok authtoken your_auth_token
```

8. **Start ngrok inside the Docker container**:

```bash
./ngrok http --hostname=ml-engine.ngrok.app 5001
```

Remember, the authentication step needs to be performed every time a new Docker container is run from the image. This is because the Docker container does not persist the state between restarts, so the authenticated ngrok state is lost when the Docker container is stopped.

Unfortunately, it's not advisable to put your ngrok authentication token directly in your Dockerfile, as this would be a security risk. Anyone who has access to the Dockerfile would be able to see and use your ngrok auth token.

Remember that this setup is mainly for development purposes. For a more secure and production-ready setup, consider using environment variables for sensitive data like the ngrok auth token, and a production-grade reverse proxy setup (like Nginx or Apache) for exposing your application to the internet.


9. Pulling Docker Images:
You can pull an image from Docker Hub using the `pull` command.

```bash
docker pull my-image
```

10. Pushing Docker Images:
If you want to push an image to Docker Hub, use the `push` command.

```bash
docker push my-image
```

11. Docker Logs:
To view the logs of a Docker container, use the `logs` command.

```bash
docker logs my-container
```

12. Building with Build Arguments:
Sometimes, you may need to pass build-time variables to Docker. This can be achieved using the `--build-arg` argument.

```bash
docker build --build-arg VAR=value -t my-app .
```

13. Setting Environment Variables:
You can set environment variables in Docker using the `-e` flag in the `run` command.

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -e VAR=value my-app
```

Make sure to create an account at https://ngrok.com/ and use the Authtoken from the account. Also, replace the URL in the index.html with the ngrok URL when created.  

Conclusion:
Mastering Docker commands can significantly speed up your development workflow and reduce the "it works on my machine" problem. This guide should serve as a good starting point for developers new to Docker, but remember, practice is key when it comes to learning and mastering any new tool. Happy Dockering!
